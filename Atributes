XML Attributes Must be Quoted
Attribute values must always be quoted. Either single or double quotes can be used.

For a person's gender, the <person> element can be written like this:

<person gender="female">
or like this:

<person gender='female'>
If the attribute value itself contains double quotes you can use single quotes, like in this example:

<gangster name='George "Shotgun" Ziegler'>
or you can use character entities:

<gangster name="George &quot;Shotgun&quot; Ziegler">
